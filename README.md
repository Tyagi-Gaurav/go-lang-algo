| Algorithm | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Ring Buffer | A ring buffer, or circular queue, is a FIFO data structure of a fixed size N. It is useful for transferring data between asynchronous processes or for storing log files. When the buffer is empty, the consumer waits until data is deposited; when the buffer is full, the producer waits to deposit data. |
| Closest Pair (1D) | Given an array a[] of N double values, finds a closest pair : two values whose difference is no greater than the the difference of any other pair (in absolute value). The running time of your program should be linearithmic in the worst case. |
